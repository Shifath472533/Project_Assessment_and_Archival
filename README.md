# Project_Assessment_and_Archival

This is a project built using MERN stack. It is a platform for student and teachers where teachers can post tasks and after the submission from the student can give marks.
Also can give updates for students to complete based on the previous submission. After the final submission the project will be automatically archived or can be uploaded by 
teacher manually if necessary and will be made available for others to view and download.

The necessary instructions are available in the documentation file inside the frontend and backend directory.
